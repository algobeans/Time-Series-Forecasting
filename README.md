# Time Series Analysis with a Generalized Additive Model

To study page view trends for a Wikipedia article on Daylight Saving Time, we first used a [Python script to extract the data from a Wikipedia database](https://github.com/algobeans/Time-Series-Forecasting/blob/master/scrapWiki.py). Next, we used a GAM package called *Prophet* published by Facebook researchers to conduct our [time series analysis in Python](https://github.com/algobeans/Time-Series-Forecasting/blob/master/Time%20Series%20Analysis.ipynb). The package is also available in R.

Overall, annual, weekly and holiday trends:

Validating the model with simulated historical forecasts:

Examining error rates:

Comparing error rates across models to check effects of parameters:
